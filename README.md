### Changes were the service Business Critical:

Should the service become business critical with 50k daily requests the following could be implemented:

1. The application could be deployed on a scaling infrastructure and put behind a web service gateway interface. This would spread the load over many different machines.
2. An in-memory database, such as redis, could be installed and used as a cache. A proxy could be setup to first direct requests directly towards the redis cache and only afterwards to the main app.
3. The app could be converted to a system that updates a redis database with key, value pair of form: 'GMT+/-HH': 'Greeting'. 
The user request would instead directly query the redis database.
